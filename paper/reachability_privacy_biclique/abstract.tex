Due to the massive volume of graph data from a wide range of recent
applications and resources required to process numerous queries at
large scale, it is becoming economically appealing to outsource graph
data to a third-party service provider (\SP), to provide query
services. However, \SP\ cannot always be trusted.  Hence, data owners
and query clients may prefer not to expose their data graphs and
queries. This paper studies privacy preserving query services for a
fundamental query for graphs namely the reachability query where {\em
  both} clients' queries and the structural information of the owner's
data are protected. We propose {\em privacy preserving 2-hop labeling}
(\pphop) where the queries are computed in an encrypted domain and the
input and output sizes of any queries are indistinguishable. We
analyze the security of \pphop\ with respect to ciphertext only and
size based attacks. We verify the performance of \pphop\ with an
experimental study on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
